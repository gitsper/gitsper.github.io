        <h4>Byzantine Resilience at Swarm Scale: A Decentralized Blocklist from Inter-robot Accusations</h4>
        
        Abstract: The Weighted-Mean Subsequence Reduced (W-MSR) algorithm, the state-of-the-art method for Byzantine-resilient design of decentralized multi-robot systems, is based on discarding outliers received over Linear Consensus Protocol (LCP). Although W-MSR provides well-understood theoretical guarantees relating robust network connectivity to the convergence of the underlying consensus, the method comes with several limitations preventing its use at scale: (1) the number of Byzantine robots, F, to tolerate should be known a priori, (2) the requirement that each robot maintains 2F+1 neighbors is impractical for large F, (3) information propagation is hindered by the requirement that F+1 robots independently make local measurements of the consensus property in order for the swarm&rsquo;s decision to change, and (4) W-MSR is specific to LCP and does not generalize to applications not implemented over LCP.

        <h4>HoLA Robots: Mitigating Plan-Deviation Attacks in Multi-Robot Systems with Co-Observations and Horizon-Limiting Announcements</h4>
        
        Abstract: Emerging multi-robot systems rely on cooperation between humans and robots, with robots following automatically generated motion plans to service application-level tasks. Given the safety requirements associated with operating in proximity to humans and expensive infrastructure, it is important to understand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities of such systems caused by compromised robots who diverge from their assigned plans. We focus on centralized systems, where a central entity (CE) is responsible for determining and transmitting the motion plans to the robots, which report their location as they move following the plan.

        <h4>Opportunistic Communication with Latency Guarantees for Intermittently-Powered Devices</h4>
        
        Abstract: Energy-harvesting wireless sensor nodes have found widespread adoption due to their low cost and small form factor. However, uncertainty in the available power supply introduces significant challenges in engineering communications between intermittently-powered nodes. We propose a constraint-based model for energy harvests that together with a hardware model can be used to enable consistent, opportunistic communication with worst-case latency guarantees. We show that greedy approaches that attempt communication whenever energy is available lead to prolonged latencies in real-world environments.

        <h4>Know the Unknowns: Addressing Disturbances and Uncertainties in Autonomous Systems</h4>
        
        Abstract: Future autonomous systems will employ complex sensing, computation, and communication components for their perception, planning, control, and coordination, and could operate in highly dynamic and uncertain environment with safety and security assurance. To realize this vision, we have to better understand and address the challenges from the &ldquo;unknowns&rdquo; &ndash; the unexpected disturbances from component faults, environmental interference, and malicious attacks, as well as the inherent uncertainties in system inputs, model inaccuracies, and machine learning techniques (particularly those based on neural networks).

        <h4>TrojDRL: Evaluation of Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning</h4>
        
        Abstract: We present TrojDRL, a tool for exploring and evaluating backdoor attacks on deep reinforcement learning agents. TrojDRL exploits the sequential nature of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and considers different gradations of threat models. We show that untargeted attacks on state-of-the-art actor-critic algorithms can circumvent existing defenses built on the assumption of backdoors being targeted. We evaluated TrojDRL on a broad set of DRL benchmarks and showed that the attacks require only poisoning as little as 0.

        <h1>Application-Aware Scheduling of Networked Applications over the Low-Power Wireless Bus</h1>
        <h6>Wed, Jan 1, 2020</h6>
        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent successes of wireless networked systems in advancing industrial
automation and in spawning the Internet of Things paradigm motivate the
adoption of wireless networked systems in current and future
safety-critical applications. As reliability is key in safety-critical
applications, in this work we present NetDAG, a scheduler design and
implementation suitable for real-time applications in the wireless
setting. NetDAG is built upon the Low-Power Wireless Bus, a
high-performant communication abstraction for wireless networked
systems, and enables system designers to directly schedule applications
under specified task-level real-time constraints. Access to real-time
primitives in the scheduler permits efficient design exploration of
tradeoffs between power consumption and latency. Furthermore, NetDAG
provides support for weakly hard real-time applications with
deterministic guarantees, in addition to heretofore considered soft
real-time applications with probabilistic guarantees. We propose novel
abstraction techniques for reasoning about conjunctions of weakly hard
constraints and show how such abstractions can be used to handle the
significant scheduling difficulties brought on by networked components
with weakly hard behaviors.</p>

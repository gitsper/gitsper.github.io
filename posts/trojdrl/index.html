        <h1>TrojDRL: Evaluation of Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning</h1>
        <h6>Tue, Feb 11, 2020</h6>
        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We present TrojDRL, a tool for exploring and evaluating backdoor attacks
on deep reinforcement learning agents. TrojDRL exploits the sequential
nature of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and considers different
gradations of threat models. We show that untargeted attacks on
state-of-the-art actor-critic algorithms can circumvent existing
defenses built on the assumption of backdoors being targeted. We
evaluated TrojDRL on a broad set of DRL benchmarks and showed that the
attacks require only poisoning as little as 0.025% of training data.
Compared with existing works of backdoor attacks on classification
models, TrojDRL provides a first step towards understanding the
vulnerability of DRL agents.</p>

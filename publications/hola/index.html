<blockquote>
<p>Emerging multi-robot systems rely on cooperation between humans and robots,
with robots following automatically generated motion plans to service
application-level tasks. Given the safety requirements associated with
operating in proximity to humans and expensive infrastructure, it is important
to understand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities of such systems caused
by compromised robots who diverge from their assigned plans.  We focus on
centralized systems, where a central entity (CE) is responsible for determining
and transmitting the motion plans to the robots, which report their location as
they move following the plan. The CE checks that robots follow their assigned
plans by comparing their expected location to the location they self-report. We
show that this self-reporting monitoring mechanism is vulnerable to
plan-deviation attacks where compromised robots don&rsquo;t follow their assigned
plans while trying to conceal their movement by mis-reporting their location.
We propose a two-pronged mitigation for plan-deviation attacks: (1) an attack
detection technique leveraging both the robots&rsquo; local sensing capabilities to
report observations of other robots and co-observation schedules generated by
the CE, and (2) a prevention technique where the CE issues horizon-limiting
announcements to the robots, reducing their instantaneous knowledge of forward
lookahead steps in the global motion plan. On a large-scale automated warehouse
benchmark, we show that our solution enables attack prevention guarantees from
a stealthy attacker that has compromised multiple robots.</p>
